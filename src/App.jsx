      <h1>üïµÔ∏è SQL Murder Mystery</h1>
      <h3>You are a detective assigned to this case. It‚Äôs up to you to figure out who did it.</h3>

        <p><strong>The Crime</strong></p>

        <p>Two seemingly unrelated deaths. One common thread: both victims consumed tampered Panadol capsules purchased from the same pharmacy.</p>

        <p><strong>Victim 1:</strong> John Snow ‚Äî died on April 3rd after taking a single capsule for a headache.</p>
        <p><strong>Victim 2:</strong> Halle Church ‚Äî died on April 12th after taking two capsules for a toothache.</p>

        <p>Autopsies confirmed both victims were killed by cyanide poisoning. The capsules were bought on different days, but from the same store. The tampering was subtle, methodical, and lethal.</p>

        <p>Police believe the poisoning was premeditated, and the capsules were altered before being sold. This wasn‚Äôt random ‚Äî someone planned this. Someone with access. Someone with motive.</p>

        <p>Your task is to use the tools at your disposal ‚Äî SQL queries, interviews, surveillance, shifts, purchases, and digital records ‚Äî to unravel the mystery.</p>

        <p>Good luck, detective.</p>
